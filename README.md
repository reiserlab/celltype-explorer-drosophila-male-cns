## Overview

This website provides an interactive catalog of neuron types from the male-cns:v0.9 dataset. The catalog allows you to explore detailed information about each neuron type, including connectivity patterns, anatomical distributions, and morphological properties.

## Getting Started

### Using the Index Page

The index page serves as the main entry point for exploring the dataset. It contains several filtering options to help you find specific neurons of interest:

**Filter Options:**
- **Neuron Type Filter**: Use the search box to filter neurons by type name. Type part of a neuron name to see matching results.
- **Hemisphere Filter**: Choose between "All", "Left", or "Right" to filter neurons by their soma hemisphere location.
- **Synapse Count Filters**: Use the slider controls to filter neurons based on their presynaptic and postsynaptic synapse counts.
- **Search and Sort**: All columns in the neuron table are sortable by clicking the column headers. Use the global search box to quickly find specific entries.

**Navigation:**
- Click on any neuron type name in the table to view detailed analysis pages
- Use the pagination controls at the bottom to browse through large datasets
- Column visibility can be toggled using the column visibility button

The filters work together, so you can combine multiple criteria to narrow down your search (e.g., show only left hemisphere neurons with more than 100 presynaptic connections).

### Advanced Filtering Options

The index page provides additional powerful filtering capabilities:

- **Sides**: Filter by hemisphere location
  - *All*: Show neuron types from all hemispheres
  - *Undefined*: Types without specified hemisphere
  - *Only Left*: Types located in the left hemisphere
  - *Only Right*: Types located in the right hemisphere
  - *Only Middle*: Types located in the midline

- **ROI**: Filter by specific regions of interest (brain regions)
  - Choose from available ROIs in the dataset
  - ROIs represent anatomically defined brain regions

- **Region**: Filter by broader anatomical regions
  - Groups related ROIs into larger functional areas
  - Helps focus on specific brain systems

- **Neurotransmitter (NT)**: Filter by predicted neurotransmitter type
  - Based on computational predictions from connectivity and gene expression
  - Common types include Acetylcholine, GABA, Glutamate, etc.

- **Cell Count**: Filter by the number of neurons in each type
  - Useful for focusing on well-represented vs. rare neuron types
  - Ranges from single neurons to large populations

### Search Functionality

Use the search box in the header to quickly find neuron types by name. The search supports:
- Partial name matching
- Case-insensitive search
- Real-time filtering as you type

### Site Navigation

## Understanding the Data

### Neuron Counts
- Numbers represent individual reconstructed neurons in the dataset
- Not all neurons of a type may be reconstructed
- Counts reflect the current state of the dataset

### Connectivity Data
- Based on synaptic connections identified in electron microscopy data
- Connection strengths represent actual synaptic counts
- Percentages show relative connection strengths within each neuron type

### Hemisphere Information
- **Left/Right**: Neurons located in the respective brain hemisphere
- **Middle**: Neurons crossing the midline or in central structures
- **Undefined**: Neurons without clear hemisphere assignment

### ROI (Regions of Interest)
ROIs represent anatomically defined brain regions based on:
- Established neuroanatomical boundaries
- Functional organization
- Developmental origins
- Published brain atlases

### Neurotransmitter Predictions
Neurotransmitter assignments are computational predictions based on:
- Connectivity patterns
- Gene expression data
- Machine learning models
- Known neurotransmitter markers

**Note**: These are predictions and should be validated experimentally.
